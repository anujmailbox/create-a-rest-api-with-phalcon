## Instructor: [Manish Kumar (MK)][instructor url]


There’s a wide range of PHP frameworks out there and all of them claim to be special, in one way or another either. One of those frameworks is Phalcon but it’ll be a mistake to consider it just another PHP framework. What makes Phalcon unique and very special is it’s speed and the way it loads and runs. Infect Its the fastest PHP framework ever built!

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Manish Kumar (MK) will show you how to create a simple REST API using the Phalcon php framework, The idea here is that you will create a rest api with functionalities like Create, Update, DELETE and Search with phalcon for a hypothetical Mobile Application that needs to consume this API. The api will be blessing fast and super easy and quick to build.
