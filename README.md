# [Create a REST API with Phalcon][published url]
## Instructor: [Manish Kumar (MK)][instructor url]


Phalcon is a full-stack PHP framework packed with the same features as all the rest, but with one important difference: Phalcon is the fastest PHP framework ever built! Instead of being written in PHP and loaded dynamically by your application, Phalcon a C-language extension that loads in your RAM as a PHP module. Which makes it blazing fast.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Manish Kumar will teach you how to get started with the Phalcon PHP framework by building a simple REST API. You'll learn how to set up a development environment, how to define a database schema and API endpoints, and how to implement create, read, updated and delete (CRUD) operations to persist data to an SQL database.
